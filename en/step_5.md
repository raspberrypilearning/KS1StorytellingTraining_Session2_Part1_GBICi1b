## Task 2: What’s ScratchJr?
You will familiarise yourself with ScratchJr and deepen your understanding of ScratchJr and the resources by completing the first lesson that the pupils themselves undertake.

The first task is to undertake [Lesson 1, Unit 1, Story-writing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b7wA-cY3q54rqUilU_Fd245pC95bfdfv?usp=sharing) (L1: What’s ScratchJr? Unit1_GBICi1b_KS1Storytelling). This lesson introduces you to both ScratchJr’s interface, including the blocks as well as set the scene for Unit 1 - introducing characters and structure in familiar songs. Lesson 1 will introduce you to the programming environment ScratchJr where you will create a simple computer program by moving a character.

For this first task you will use two resources: the teacher-facing [Lesson Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ptqLfHIQOY21TtUtMdspEbetHGIfEIIuPpAY3Bjthbk/edit?usp=sharing) and the [Presentation slides for Lesson 1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vdB9fT2_-8fgi7Savm7bmh3nvPPkUmzHZQeglXPflMs/edit?usp=sharing) in the Lesson 1, [Unit 1 folder](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vdB9fT2_-8fgi7Savm7bmh3nvPPkUmzHZQeglXPflMs/edit?usp=sharing) (again note that the Presentation Slides label the activities in the top right-hand corner to help you navigate the lesson).

Make a note of anything which you need to clarify. You can use the feedback form to ask questions to the trial community. Or get in touch with us if you have any queries at any time before, during or after the trial by emailing the Gender Research Mailbox on [genderresearch@raspberrypi.org](genderresearch@raspberrypi.org).
