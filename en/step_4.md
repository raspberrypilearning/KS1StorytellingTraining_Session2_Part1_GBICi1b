## Task 1: Technical set-up for trial

Check you are prepared for the trial. This step is the first in a series of tasks in order to ensure that the technical set-up is arranged well in advance of your trial  and lesson delivery. You will need to install an app or software to the class devices and you may well need to bring in expertise, seek permissions or source additional hardware. 

**Devices and live demonstrations**
Ideally, all demonstrations of programming should be done live. Set-up well in advance of the trial as you may well need to bring in expertise, seek permissions or source additional hardware. 

For tablets/iPads, you will be able to chose connectivity from bluetooth, WiFi or hardware (such as an HDMI AV adaptor):
+ Android tablet - search online for ‘screen mirroring’ with the ‘make/model of your device’.
+ iPad - follow information on [Apple TV/AirPlay](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204289) or [AV adaptor](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202044). 
+ Desktop computer - it is possible to demonstrate from the teacher’s interactive white board or an alternative monitor using the ScratchJr [Emulator](https://jfo8000.github.io/ScratchJr-Desktop) which works on a PC or Mac desktop computer. Teachers may choose to use a desktop emulator for the purpose of demonstrations with the pupils using tablets/iPads.

The practicalities of demonstration need to be considered when creating the seating plan. There are real benefits to live demonstration which will require that teachers practise modifying and creating the programs in ScratchJr which are referenced within the lessons. If demonstration is not practical, each set of lesson slides offers an alternative to live demonstration. 

**ScratchJr**
Download the ScratchJr app on your chosen computer devices. Follow the relevant link below: 
+ Android device such as tablets - [GooglePlay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.scratchjr.android&hl=en_GB)
+ iPads - [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scratchjr/id895485086)
+ Desktop computer - [Emulator](https://jfo8000.github.io/ScratchJr-Desktop). The link gives information on the latest install for Mac or Windows computers.

For all activities in the Units, learners can work in pairs. If sharing devices, organise pupils’ seating in advance to allow for pairings. If you do choose for pupils to work in pairs and there is an odd number of pupils, then three pupils can work together. Preallocate an area in the classroom for them to ensure that they have plenty of space and a good monitor. Ensure that pairs take regular equivalent turns controlling their shared device so that one pupil does not dominate the other.
